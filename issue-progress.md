# Log Forwarding & Integrations Progress

## Implementation Log

### Week 1: Core Infrastructure

#### Day 1 - 2025-01-23

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/log-forwarding-integrations`
- ✅ Created progress tracking log (this file)
- ✅ Set up directory structure in `inc/integrations/`
- ✅ Created interface contracts (`Interface_Integration`, `Interface_Alert_Rule`)
- ✅ Implemented `Integrations_Manager` service class
- ✅ Created abstract `Integration` base class with common functionality
- ✅ Built `Alert_Rules_Engine` foundation for rule evaluation
- ✅ Implemented `File_Integration` class as free tier feature
- ✅ Created `Integrations_Service` for system registration
- ✅ Added autoloader namespace for integrations
- ✅ Validated PHP syntax for all new files

**Next Steps:**
- Add basic CSS styles for settings UI
- Test the integration system with actual logging
- Create commit with initial implementation

**Blockers/Notes:**
- ✅ Fixed autoloader issue: Interface files must be named with pattern `interface-{class-name}.php`
  - Renamed: `interface-integration.php` → `interface-integration-interface.php`
  - Renamed: `interface-alert-rule.php` → `interface-alert-rule-interface.php`
- ✅ Fixed PHP 8.2 deprecation warning: Added property declaration for `$integrations_manager` in Simple_History class
- ✅ Fixed WordPress 6.7 translation loading warning: Moved translatable strings from constructor to getter methods to ensure translations load after `init` action
- ✅ Fixed missing settings page: Created proper `Integrations_Settings_Page` service using Menu Manager and Menu Page classes (following the pattern from Licences Settings Page)
- ✅ Fixed PHPStan error: Added proper type checking for `get_service()` return value in settings page
- ✅ Fixed all WordPress coding standards violations: All integrations code now passes PHPCS linting

**Technical Details:**
- Used industry-standard "Integrations" terminology
- File integration uses simple, human-readable log format only
- Secure log directory with hard-to-guess names based on site hash (e.g., `simple-history-logs-a1b2c3d4/`)
- Stores logs in wp-content with site-specific hash for security
- Log files use "events" naming (e.g., `events-2025-01-23.log`)
- Minimal settings: only file rotation frequency and cleanup retention
- No complex features: no file size limits, no custom directories, no format selection, no test connection button
- Shows file path to users so they know where to find the log files
- Smart cleanup: only removes files matching current rotation frequency pattern
- Async processing foundation (ready for premium integrations)
- Proper error handling and logging throughout

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Using "Integrations" terminology (matches industry standards like Sentry, Datadog)
- File integration as free tier to demonstrate system value
- Following Simple History's existing service/dropin patterns
