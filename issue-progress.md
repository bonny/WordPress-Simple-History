#### Day 1 - 2025-01-23

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/log-forwarding-integrations`

- ✅ Added autoloader namespace for integrations
- ✅ Validated PHP syntax for all new files

**Next Steps:**

**Blockers/Notes:**
- None

**Technical Details:**
- Used industry-standard "Integrations" terminology
- File integration includes multiple formats (simple, JSON, CSV)
- Supports file rotation and cleanup
- Async processing foundation (ready for premium integrations)
- Proper error handling and logging throughout

**Key Decisions Made:**
