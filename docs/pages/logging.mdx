# Logging API

You can add messages to the history log from your own PHP code, for example in a custom WordPress plugin or from your WordPress theme.

## Using filters

### Adding messages

The easiest and most safe way to log messages is using the WordPress PHP function [`apply_filters`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/apply_filters/).

<Callout emoji="👍">
	Because `apply_filters` is a function that is built into WordPress *your site
	won't break* if Simple History is not available, for example if the plugin has
	been disabled.
</Callout>

```php
apply_filters(
	'simple_history_log',
	'This is a logged message'
);
```

<LogItem
	who="Jane Doe"
	text="This is a logged message"
	date="April 5, 2022 - 22:23 (25 days ago)"
/>

### Adding log level

By default messages are added with log level info. If you need to log something that has
a higher severity then you can specify the log level using a fourth parameter:

```php
apply_filters(
	'simple_history_log',
	'This is another logged message, with another severity level',
	null,
	'warning'
);
```

<LogItem
	who="Jane Doe"
	text="This is another logged message, with another severity level"
	date="April 5, 2022 - 22:23 (25 days ago)"
	level="warning"
/>

### Adding context

You can also add messages with context:

```php
apply_filters(
	'simple_history_log',
	'User {username} created a compressed backup with the name {backup_name} with format {backup_format}',
	[
		'username' => 'Jane',
		'backup_name' => 'orders-backup.zip',
		'backup_format' => 'CSV'
	],
	'alert'
);
```

<LogItem
	who="Jane Doe"
	text="User Jane created a compressed backup with the name orders-backup.zip with format CSV"
	date="April 5, 2022 - 22:23 (25 days ago)"
	level="alert"
/>

## Using SimpleLogger()

### Adding messages

If you are sure that Simple History is loaded you can use function `SimpleLogger()` to log things.
This method may be prefered if you log a lot of things, use many variables, need to manually add initiator,
or just because it looks cooler 😎.

<Callout emoji="💡">
	To be sure nothing breaks if Simple History is disabled you can for example
	wrap each of the calls below inside a `function_exists( 'SimpleLogger' )`.
</Callout>

Add a simple information message to the log:

```php
SimpleLogger()->info( 'This is a message added to the log' );
```

<LogItem
	who="Jane Doe"
	text="This is a message added to the log"
	date="April 5, 2022 - 22:23 (25 days ago)"
	level="info"
/>

### Adding log level

You can add messages with different severity using any of the
[log levels specified in PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/#5-psrlogloglevel): "info" (default), "notice", "warning", and so on:

```php
SimpleLogger()->warning( 'User "Jessie" deleted user "Kim"' );
SimpleLogger()->alert( 'Space is running low on the hard drive!' );
SimpleLogger()->debug( 'Ok, cron job is running!' );
```

<LogItems>
	<LogItem text='User "Jessie" deleted user "Kim"' level="warning" />
	<LogItem text="Space is running low on the hard drive!" level="alert" />
	<LogItem text="Ok, cron job is running!" level="debug" />
</LogItems>

### Adding context

Log entries can have placeholders and context.
This makes log entries translatable and filterable.
And it also makes it easier to find all messages of the same type when searching.
The values that you add in the context array does not need to have
a corresponding placeholder name in the message, so it's possible to add some extra information
that is only visible when viewing more details about an event.

```php
SimpleLogger()->notice(
	'User {username} edited page {pagename}',
	[
		'username' => 'jessie',
		'pagename' => 'My test page',
		'page_id' => 124,
		'some_nice_to_have_extra_value' => 'My useful extra value'
	]
);
```

<LogItem text="User jessie edited page My test page" />

<p>
	Note that `page_id` and `some_nice_to_have_extra_value` are saved to the
	database, but they are not shown in the main log feed.
</p>

### Automatic grouping of messages

If many entries of the same kind is logged the activity feed can be a bit crowded with messages.
That's why Simple History by defaults groups similar messages, for example login attempts or post updates.
If a user is editing a page on your website they may edit the page many times and we don't want the edit of a
single post to take over the feed completely.

```php
// Add a message to the history log
// and then add a second log entry with same info and Simple History
// will make these two become an "occasionGroup",
// i.e. collapsing their entries into one expandable log item.
SimpleLogger()->info( 'This is a message sent to the log' );
SimpleLogger()->info( 'This is a message sent to the log' );

// Log entries can have custom occasionsID.
// This will group items together and a log entry will only be shown once
// in the log overview, even if the logged messages are different.
for ( $i = 0; $i < rand( 1, 50 ); $i++ ) {
	SimpleLogger()->notice(
		'User {username} edited page {pagename}',
		[
			'username' => "example_user_{$i}",
			'pagename' => 'My test page',
			'_occasionsID' => 'postID:24884,action:edited',
		]
	);
}
```

<LogItems>
	<LogItem text="This is a message sent to the log" similarCount={2} />
	<LogItem
		text="User {example_user_0} edited page My test page"
		similarCount={24}
	/>
</LogItems>

### Initiator

By default Simple History automatically determines who is responsible for something that happens.
You can however override this if needed by adding an `_initiator` key to the context array.

The available initiators are specified in the `SimpleLoggerLogInitiators` class and they are:

- WP_USER
- WEB_USER
- WORDPRESS
- WP_CLI
- OTHER

```php
// Events can have different "initiators",
// i.e. who was responsible for the logged event
// Initiator "WORDPRESS" means that WordPress did something on it's own
SimpleLogger()->notice(
	'User {username} edited page {pagename}',
	[
		'username' => 'jessie',
		'pagename' => 'My test page',
		'_initiator' => SimpleLoggerLogInitiators::WP_USER,
		'_user_id' => 5,
		'_user_login' => 'jess',
		'_user_email' => 'jessie@example.com',
	]
);

SimpleLogger()->info(
	'WordPress updated itself from version {from_version} to {to_version}',
	[
		'from_version' => '3.8',
		'to_version' => '3.8.1',
		'_initiator' => SimpleLoggerLogInitiators::WORDPRESS,
	]
);

// Initiator "WP_USER" means that a logged in user did something
SimpleLogger()->info(
	'Updated plugin {plugin_name} from version {plugin_from_version} to version {plugin_to_version}',
	array(
		'plugin_name' => 'Query Monitor',
		'plugin_from_version' => '3.8.2',
		'plugin_to_version' => '3.9.0',
		'_initiator' => SimpleLoggerLogInitiators::WP_CLI,
	)
);

// Initiator "WEB_USER" means that an unknown internet user did something
SimpleLogger()->warning(
	"An attempt to login as user 'administrator' failed to login because the wrong password was entered",
	[
		'_initiator' => SimpleLoggerLogInitiators::WEB_USER,
	]
);
```

<LogItems>
	<LogItem who="jess" text="User jessie edited page My test page" />  
    <LogItem
    	who="WordPress"
    	text="WordPress updated itself from version 3.8 to 3.8.1"
    />
    <LogItem
    	who="WP-CLI"
    	text="Updated plugin Query Monitor from version 3.8.2 to version 3.9.0"
    />    
  	<LogItem
    	who="WEB_USER"
    	text="An attempt to login as user 'administrator' failed to login because the wrong password was entered"
    />
</LogItems>
