## WordPress.org Plugin Guidelines: Free vs Premium Code

**Core rule:** No premium/locked code in wp.org plugins. All hosted code must be free and fully functional.

**Not allowed:**

-   Features disabled until license key entered
-   Functionality restricted behind paywall
-   Trialware (time limits, quotas)
-   License validation services for locally-included features

**Allowed:**

-   Upselling/advertising premium features (within reason)
-   Separate premium add-on plugins distributed from your own site
-   SaaS integrations with external paid services (if service provides real functionality)

**Recommended freemium model:**

-   Free plugin on wp.org: fully functional, no locked code
-   Premium plugin: separate download from your store, extends/replaces free version
-   Premium can install alongside free (add-on style) or replace it entirely
