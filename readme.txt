== Description ==

Simple History shows recent changes made within WordPress, directly on your dashboard or on a separate page.

The plugin works as a log/history/audit log/version history of the most important events that occur in WordPress.

Out of the box Simple History has support for:

* **Posts and pages**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted a post or page
* **Attachments**<br>
see who added, updated or deleted an attachment
* **Comments**<br>
see who edited, approved or removed a comment
* **Widgets**<br>
get info when someone adds, updates or removes a widget in a sidebar
* **Plugins**<br>
activation and deactivation
* **User profiles**<br>
info about added, updated or removed users
* **User logins**<br>
see when a user login & logut
* **Failed user logins**<br>
see when someone has tried to log in, but failed. The log will then include ip address of the possible hacker.
* **bbPress**<br>
view changes to forums and topics and view user changes
* **Gravity Forms**<br>
see who created, edited or deleted a form, field, or entry

With it's easy to use Extender system, developers can add their own settings and items to track.

There is also a **RSS feed of changes** available, so you can keep track of the changes made
via your favorite RSS reader on your phone, on your iPad, or on your computer.

It’s a plugin that is good to have on websites where several people are 
involved in editing the content.

#### Example scenarios

Keep track of what other people are doing:
_"Has someone done anything today? Ah, Sarah uploaded 
the new press release and created an article for it. Great! Now I don't have to do that."_

Or for debug purposes:
_"The site feels very slow since yesterday. Has anyone done anything special? ... Ah, Steven activated 'naughy-plugin-x',
that must be it."_

#### See it in action

#### Add your own events to simple history

If you are a plugin developer and would like to add your own things/events to Simple History
you can do that by calling the function simple_history_add like this:
`<?php

# Check that function exists before trying to use it
# Just in case someone disabled the history plugin or similar
if (function_exists("simple_history_add")) {

	# Log that an email has been sent
	simple_history_add(array(
		"object_type" => "Email",
		"object_name" => "Hi there",
		"action" => "was sent"
	));

	# Will show “Plugin your_plugin_name Edited” in the history log
	simple_history_add("action=edited&object_type=plugin&object_name=your_plugin_name");
	
	# Will show the history item "Starship USS Enterprise repaired"
	simple_history_add("action=repaired&object_type=Starship&object_name=USS Enterprise");

	# Log with some extra details about the email
	simple_history_add(array(
		"object_type" => "Email",
		"object_name" => "Hi there",
		"action" => "was sent",
		"description" => "The database query to generate the email took .3 seconds. This is email number 4 that is sent to this user"
	));

?>
`

#### Add support for your own custom events

There's also a simple class that you can extend to add support for custom history items. It's super simple to use! Take a look at `class.simple-history-extend.php` to get started, and then extending Simple_History_Extend and fill the required methods with their events and log messages.

#### Never clear the history

By default the items in the history log is cleared automatically afer 60 days. 
You can override this behaviour by using a filter, like this:

`
<?php
// Never clear the database
add_action("simple_history_allow_db_purge", function($bool) {
	return false;
});
?>
`

#### Filters

Available filters if you want to modify any behavior

* simple_history_rss_item_title
* simple_history_view_history_capability
* simple_history_show_settings_page
* simple_history_rss_item_description
* simple_history_rss_item_title
* simple_history_show_on_dashboard
* simple_history_show_as_page
* simple_history_allow_db_purge
* simple_history_db_purge_days_interval

- Added POT-file

= 0.3.5 =
- using get_the_title instead of fetching the title directly from the post object. should make plugins like qtranslate work a bit better.

- Could get cryptic "simpleHistoryNoMoreItems"-text when loading a type with no items.

= 0.3.4 =
- RSS-feed is now valid, and should work at more places (could be broken because of html entities and stuff)

= 0.3.3 =

- mouse over on date now display detailed date a bit faster
- layout fixes to make it cooler, better, faster, stronger
- multiple events of same type, performed on the same object, by the same user, are now grouped together. This way 30 edits on the same page does not end up with 30 rows in Simple History. Much better overview!
- the name of deleted items now show up, instead of "Unknown name" or similar
- added support for plugins (who activated/deactivated what plugin)
- support for third party history items. Use like this:
simple_history_add("action=repaired&object_type=starship&object_name=USS Enterprise");
this would result in somehting like this:
Starship "USS Enterprise" repaired
by admin (John Doe), just now
- capability edit_pages needed to show history. Is this an appropriate capability do you think?

= 0.2 =
* Compatible with 2.9.2

= 0.1 =
* First public version. It works!
