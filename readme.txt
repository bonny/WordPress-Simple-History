## Description

> _"So far the best and most comprehensive logging plugin"_ - [@herrschuessler](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/so-far-the-best-and-most-comprehensive-logging-plugin/)

Simple History shows recent changes made within WordPress, directly on your dashboard, on a separate page, or in the admin bar.

The plugin acts as an audit log of the most important events that occur in WordPress.

It's a plugin that is good to have on websites where several people are involved in editing the content.

No coding is required to use the plugin. Just install it and it will start logging events.

### üîç How Simple History Helps in Real Situations

**Track what's happening on your site**  
_"Has someone done anything today? Ah, Sarah uploaded the new press release and created an article for it. Great! Now I don't have to do that."_

**Identify issues and debug faster**  
_"The site feels slow since yesterday. Has anyone done anything special? ... Ah, Steven activated 'naughty-plugin-x', that must be it."_

**Keep Freelancers & Agencies Accountable**
_"I hired a developer to optimize my site. But did they actually do anything? A quick glance at Simple History shows me exactly what they worked on, so I know I'm getting my money's worth!"_

### üöÄ Zero-Config Activity Tracking

Simple History begins tracking your WordPress site's activities instantly after installation - no setup required. View your activity logs through the convenient dashboard widget or browse the full history on the dedicated 'Simple History' page in your WordPress admin.

### üì° RSS feed with changes

Using the optional password protected **RSS feed** you can keep track of the changes made on your website using your favorite RSS reader.

### ü§ñ WP-CLI commands for automation

[Multiple WP-CLI commands exist](https://simple-history.com/features/wp-cli-commands/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin_directory&utm_campaign=documentation&utm_content=readme_doc_wp_cli_commands), to view and search the log, and to view more information about a specific event.

WP-CLI support is perfect for system administrators and agencies managing multiple WordPress sites. Using WP-CLI commands they can automate log monitoring, create reports, or integrate with existing DevOps tools.

Example commands:

-   `wp simple-history event list` ‚Äì List the latest logged events.
-   `simple-history event get` ‚Äì Get more information about a specific event.
-   `wp simple-history event add` ‚Äì Add a custom event to the log.
-   `wp simple-history event search` ‚Äì Search for events.
-   `wp simple-history stealth-mode` ‚Äì See Stealth Mode status.

### ü•∑ Stealth Mode ‚Äì Hide Simple History from the WordPress Admin

[Stealth Mode](https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin_directory&utm_campaign=documentation&utm_content=readme_doc_stealth_mode) allows Simple History to run completely in the background, hidden from the WordPress admin interface. This is ideal for agencies, developers, and administrators who want to track user activity discreetly without exposing the logs to other users.

There are two modes:

-   **Full Stealth Mode** ‚Äì Completely hides Simple History from everyone.
-   **Partial Stealth Mode** ‚Äì Hides the plugin but allows selected users to access the logs.

The activity log remains accessible via the REST API, WP-CLI, and RSS feed, ensuring administrators can still retrieve logs when needed.

Stealth Mode is enabled using a constant or filter, allowing you to customize who can access the logs while keeping the plugin hidden in the admin interface.

### üìù Add your own events to the log using the API

Theme and plugin developers can log custom events in Simple History using the `simple_history_log` filter:

`apply_filters(
  'simple_history_log',
  'This is a logged message'
);`

See the [documentation](https://simple-history.com/docs/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin_directory&utm_campaign=documentation&utm_content=readme_doc_overview) for examples on how to [log your own events](https://simple-history.com/docs/logging-api/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin_directory&utm_campaign=documentation&utm_content=readme_doc_logging_api), [query the log](https://simple-history.com/docs/query-api/?utm_source=wordpress_org&utm_medium=plugin_directory&utm_campaign=documentation&utm_content=readme_doc_query_api), and more.
