## Events have context with extra details

Each logged event can include useful rich formatted extra information. For example: a plugin install can contain author info and a the url to the plugin, and an uploaded image can contain a thumbnail of the image.

## Plugin API

Developers can easily log their own things using a simple API:

```php
<?php

// This is the easiest and safest way to add messages to the log
// If the plugin is disabled this way will not generate in any error
apply_filters("simple_history_log", "This is a logged message");

// Or with some context and with log level debug:
apply_filters(
	'simple_history_log',
	'My message about something',
	[
		'debugThing' => $myThingThatIWantIncludedInTheLoggedEvent,
		'anotherThing' => $anotherThing
	],
	'debug'
);

// Or just debug a message quickly
apply_filters('simple_history_log_debug', 'My debug message');

// You can also use functions/methods to add events to the log
SimpleLogger()->info("This is a message sent to the log");

// Add events of different severity
SimpleLogger()->info("User admin edited page 'About our company'");
SimpleLogger()->warning("User 'Jessie' deleted user 'Kim'");
SimpleLogger()->debug("Ok, cron job is running!");
```
