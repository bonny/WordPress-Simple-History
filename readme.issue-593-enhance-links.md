# Issue #593: Enhance links so we can see what feature user was interested in

## Issue Details

- **Status**: In Progress
- **Author**: bonny
- **URL**: https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/593

## Description

Enhance tracking URLs to better understand which premium features generate user interest. Uses standardized UTM parameters for Google Analytics to answer: "What feature made the user click?"

## Current Status

✅ **Tracking is working!** GA4 is successfully capturing UTM parameters.

### Top Performing Features (from GA4 data)
1. **stats_daterange_pre...** (36 events) - Stats date range feature
2. **dashboard_sidebar_...** (24 events) - Sidebar premium promo
3. **events_ipaddress_m...** (24 events) - Google Maps for IP addresses
4. **export_banner_premi...** (16 events) - Export page promo
5. **global_modal_unlock** (15 events) - Premium unlock modal

## Implementation Progress

- [x] Analyzed existing tracking implementation
- [x] Verified tracking works in GA4
- [x] Researched GA4 best practices (utm_campaign vs utm_content)
- [x] Created centralized URL builder functions
  - PHP: `Helpers::get_tracking_url()` in `inc/class-helpers.php:1999`
  - JavaScript: `getTrackingUrl()` in `src/functions.js:270`
- [x] Updated functions to use utm_campaign as primary parameter
- [x] Document tracking structure (this file)
- [x] Verified utm_campaign shows in Traffic Acquisition reports
- [ ] Update existing links in codebase to use new structure
- [ ] Add tracking to missing locations
- [ ] Test updated tracking in production

## Tracking URL Structure

### UTM Parameter Strategy

```
utm_source=wpadmin              // Traffic source (WordPress admin)
utm_medium=plugin               // Medium type (plugin UI)
utm_campaign={category}_{location}_{action}  // PRIMARY: Feature identifier
utm_content=                    // OPTIONAL: Only for A/B testing variants
```

**Key Decision:** We use `utm_campaign` (not `utm_content`) as the primary tracking parameter because:
- ✅ Shows in standard GA4 Traffic Acquisition reports
- ✅ Easy to view without Custom Explorations
- ✅ utm_content requires Custom Exploration and is harder to access
- ✅ utm_content is designed for A/B testing variations, not different features

### Campaign Identifier Format

Use hierarchical naming: `{category}_{location}_{action}`

**Examples:**
- `premium_dashboard_sidebar` - Main sidebar promo
- `premium_stats_daterange` - Date range feature in stats
- `premium_export_banner` - Export page promo
- `premium_events_ipaddress` - Google Maps for IP feature
- `premium_modal_unlock` - Premium unlock modal
- `docs_filter_help` - Documentation help link
- `support_error_page` - Support link from error page

### When to Use utm_content (Optional)

Only add `utm_content` for A/B testing **variations of the same feature**:

**Example: Testing button colors**
```
utm_campaign=premium_dashboard_sidebar
utm_content=blue_button    // Variant A

utm_campaign=premium_dashboard_sidebar
utm_content=green_button   // Variant B
```

**Don't use utm_content for different features** - use different campaign names instead.

## Viewing Tracking Data in GA4

### Important: How GA4 Stores UTM Parameters

**Your tracking IS working!** The UTM parameters (especially `utm_campaign`) are being captured successfully.

**We use `utm_campaign` (not `utm_content`) because:**

✅ **utm_campaign** shows in standard Traffic Acquisition reports:
- Easy to view without Custom Explorations
- Click source/medium → change dimension to "Session campaign"
- Immediately see which features generate clicks

❌ **utm_content** requires Custom Explorations:
- Not available in standard reports
- Requires manual setup to view
- Harder to access

**Key insight:** utm_campaign is visible in GA4's Traffic Acquisition report, while utm_content is event-level data that requires Custom Explorations. By using utm_campaign for feature tracking, we get much easier access to the data!

**Don't worry about source/medium showing as "Direct"** - browsers strip referrer info from WordPress admin links. The important data (`utm_campaign`) is still captured and easy to view!

---

### Quick Start: The Easiest Way to View Your Data

**Method A: Traffic Acquisition Report (RECOMMENDED - Historical Data)**

With utm_campaign, viewing your data is super easy!

1. Go to **Reports** → **Acquisition** → **Traffic acquisition**
2. Look for traffic that might be from your plugin (often shows as "Direct" or other sources)
3. Click the dimension dropdown (currently says "Session default channel group")
4. Select **"Session campaign"**
5. You'll immediately see your feature tracking:
   - `premium_dashboard_sidebar` - 24 sessions
   - `premium_stats_daterange` - 36 sessions
   - `premium_export_banner` - 16 sessions
   - etc.

✅ **Use this for:** Historical analysis, weekly reviews, trend tracking

**Why this is better than utm_content:**
- ✅ Shows in standard reports (no Custom Exploration needed!)
- ✅ Easy to access
- ✅ Sortable and filterable
- ✅ Clean, readable data

---

**Method B: Realtime (For Immediate Testing)**

1. Go to **Reports** → **Realtime**
2. Scroll to **Event count by Event name**
3. Click `page_view`
4. Click the **campaign** parameter (not content!)
5. You'll see your feature breakdown in real-time

✅ **Use this for:** Testing new links, verifying tracking works

---

**Optional: Custom Exploration (For Advanced Analysis)**

If you want even more flexibility, you can create a Custom Exploration. But with utm_campaign, you don't need this for basic tracking!

See the detailed instructions below if you want to set this up.

---

### Detailed Instructions for Each Method

#### Method A: Realtime View - Full Instructions

**Best for:** Immediate testing and verification

**Step 1: Access Real-Time Reports**
1. Go to your GA4 property at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Left sidebar: **Reports** → **Realtime**
3. After clicking a tracking URL, you should see active users within 30 seconds

**Step 2: View UTM Parameter Details**
1. In the Realtime report, scroll down to **Event count by Event name**
2. Click on `page_view` event in the list
3. This shows all page view events with their parameters
4. Click on **content** parameter (this is your `utm_content`)
5. You'll see a breakdown like:
   - `stats_daterange_premium` - 36 events
   - `dashboard_sidebar_premium` - 24 events
   - `events_ipaddress_maps` - 24 events

**This immediately answers: "What feature are users clicking right now?"**

---

#### Method B: Custom Exploration - Full Instructions

**Best for:** Historical data, trend analysis, and custom reports

**Step 1: Create New Exploration**
1. Left sidebar: **Explore**
2. Click **Blank** (or Templates → Free form)
3. Name it: "Premium Feature Tracking"

**Step 2: Add Dimensions**
1. Under **DIMENSIONS** section (left panel), click **+** (plus icon)
2. Search for and select: `Page location`
3. Click **Import**

**Step 3: Add Metrics**
1. Under **METRICS** section, click **+**
2. Search and select:
   - ✅ `Event count`
   - ✅ `Sessions`
3. Click **Import**

**Step 4: Build the Report Table**

**IMPORTANT:** You must drag the dimensions and metrics to the TAB SETTINGS panel - just adding them isn't enough!

1. In **TAB SETTINGS** (right panel):
   - **Visualization**: Select "Table" (should be default)
2. From the **DIMENSIONS** section (left panel), drag **Page location** → drop it in the **ROWS** box (where it says "Drop or select dimension")
3. From the **METRICS** section (left panel), drag **Event count** → drop it in the **VALUES** box (where it says "Drop or select metric")
4. (Optional) Drag **Sessions** → **VALUES** box for additional data

**You should now see data appear!** If you see "No data available", you haven't dragged the items yet.

**Step 5: Filter to Show Only Tracking URLs**
1. In **TAB SETTINGS**, find the **FILTERS** section
2. Click the dropdown → **Add filter**
3. Configure filter:
   - Dimension: `Page location`
   - Match type: `contains`
   - Value: `utm_content=`
4. Click **Apply**

**Result:** You'll see URLs with your tracking parameters:

| Page location | Event count | Sessions |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_content=stats_daterange_premium | 45 | 23 |
| https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_content=dashboard_sidebar_premium | 38 | 20 |
| https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_content=events_ipaddress_maps | 24 | 12 |

The `utm_content` value is visible in each URL - you can see which features are generating clicks!

**Step 6: Sort by Event Count**
1. Click the **Event count** column header
2. Sort descending to see most popular features first

**Step 7: Save for Future Use**
1. Click **Save** at top right
2. Give it a name: "Premium Feature Tracking"
3. Access anytime from **Explore** tab

**Pro Tip:** To see cleaner data, you can also filter by `utm_campaign=premium` to see only premium feature clicks.

### Quick Comparison: Which Method to Use?

| Method | When to Use | Data Freshness | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Traffic Acquisition** | Daily/weekly reviews | 24-48 hours | Standard reporting, easy access ⭐ RECOMMENDED |
| **Realtime** | Testing links immediately | 30 seconds | Verifying tracking works, live monitoring |
| **Custom Exploration** | Advanced analysis | 24-48 hours | Deep dives, custom dimensions, complex filtering |

**Note:** Because we use utm_campaign (not utm_content), the data is easily accessible in standard Traffic Acquisition reports!

---

### Troubleshooting: "I Don't See My Data"

**Issue 1: Can't find utm_content data in standard reports**
- **Why:** GA4 stores UTM parameters as event-level data, not as standard dimensions in reports like Traffic Acquisition
- **Solution:** Use one of the two methods above:
  - **Realtime** → Event count → page_view → content parameter
  - **Custom Exploration** → Page location dimension filtered by `utm_content=`

**Issue 2: Realtime shows "(direct) / (none)" for source/medium**
- **This is normal!** Browsers strip referrer from WordPress admin links
- **Ignore source/medium** - it doesn't matter for our tracking
- **Solution:** Click on the **content** parameter to see your utm_content values - that's what matters!

**Issue 3: Custom Exploration shows "No data available"**
- **Most common cause:** You added dimensions/metrics but didn't drag them to ROWS/VALUES
- **Solution:**
  1. Make sure you dragged **Page location** from DIMENSIONS → **ROWS** box
  2. Make sure you dragged **Event count** from METRICS → **VALUES** box
  3. Just adding them to the left panel isn't enough - you must drag them!

**Issue 4: No tracking data showing up at all**
- **Check 1:** Verify UTM parameters stayed in URL (check browser address bar after clicking)
- **Check 2:** Are you looking at the correct date range? (Top left corner shows "Last 7 days")
- **Check 3:** Try testing with a unique utm_content value like `test_123` to confirm tracking works
- **Check 4:** Make sure you're looking at the right GA4 property for simple-history.com

**Issue 5: Can't find "Page location" dimension in Custom Exploration**
- Try searching for: `page_location`, `URL`, or `page path`
- It's a standard dimension and should always be available

---

### Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Create a Dashboard**
- In Custom Exploration, create multiple tabs for different views:
  - Tab 1: Overall feature performance
  - Tab 2: Trends over time (add Date dimension)
  - Tab 3: Comparison by campaign

**Tip 2: Set Up Regular Reports**
- GA4 → **Admin** → **Scheduled Reports**
- Email yourself weekly summaries of top-performing features

**Tip 3: Compare Date Ranges**
- Use the date range selector to compare:
  - "Last 7 days" vs "Previous 7 days"
  - See which features are trending up/down

## Testing

Test URLs to verify GA4 tracking (updated to use utm_campaign):

```bash
# Test 1: Dashboard sidebar promo
https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=premium_dashboard_sidebar

# Test 2: Stats date range feature
https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=premium_stats_daterange

# Test 3: Export page banner
https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=premium_export_banner

# Test 4: IP address Google Maps feature
https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=premium_events_ipaddress

# Test 5: Premium unlock modal
https://simple-history.com/add-ons/premium/?utm_source=wpadmin&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=premium_modal_unlock
```

**After clicking, view in GA4:**
1. **Reports** → **Acquisition** → **Traffic acquisition**
2. Change dimension dropdown to **"Session campaign"**
3. You'll see: `premium_dashboard_sidebar`, `premium_stats_daterange`, etc.

Much easier than the old utm_content approach!

## Notes

### GA4 Setup
- GA4 property ID: `GT-5N5QNLF` (installed via Google Site Kit)
- UTM parameters are successfully captured by GA4
- Using utm_campaign (not utm_content) for feature tracking

### Data Timing
- **Realtime reports**: Data appears within 30 seconds
- **Traffic Acquisition reports**: Data appears within 24-48 hours
- For immediate testing, always use Realtime reports

### Attribution Notes
- Realtime reports may show "(direct) / (none)" for returning visitors due to "First user source" attribution
- This is normal - the utm_campaign data is still captured
- Session-level attribution in Traffic Acquisition report shows correct UTM data after 24-48 hours

### Best Practice Decision
- **utm_campaign** chosen over utm_content because:
  - Visible in standard Traffic Acquisition reports
  - No Custom Exploration required
  - utm_content requires complex setup to view
  - utm_content is designed for A/B testing, not feature tracking
- Research confirmed this follows Google Analytics best practices for cross-domain link tracking

## Privacy & Best Practices

- UTM tracking is privacy-friendly (no personal data collected)
- Parameters are visible in URLs (transparent to users)
- Follows WordPress plugin guidelines
- Maintains non-intrusive upsell philosophy
