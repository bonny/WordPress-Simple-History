# Simple History code standard

Since I always forget what standards I use in different projects this file is here to remind me about the standards I use in this project:

- Code standards is WordPress own.
- **phpcodesniffer** is used to format code.
- **phpstan** is used to check for bugs.
- **rector** is used to update code.

## phpcodesniffer

Uses composer package `dealerdirect/phpcodesniffer-composer-installer` to find PHP_CodeSniffer rules automagically. Run `composer install` and then `vendor/bin/phpcs`.

Use PHP 7.4 (the WordPress rules crashes on PHP 8 so far, bug fixed but no version with fix released).

- `phpcs.xml.dist` is the config used.
- `$ vendor/bin/phpcs` to lint PHP from command line after editing.
- Formatting:
    `$ vendor/bin/phpcs phpcbf` to fix (write to disk) errors and warning.

## phpstan

**PHPStan** is used to analyze code.

Config is in `phpstan.neon`.

- `$ vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit 2048M .`

## Rector

- **Rector** is used to update code to 7.4 and to refactor code to better quality.
    - Dry run with `$ vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run`
    - Run without `--dry-run` to write changes.
    - Run with docker using `docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD":/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp php:7.4-cli php vendor/bin/rector process --dry-run`
- Changelog: try to use format from https://keepachangelog.com.

## How to use in Visual Studio Code

- Run `composer install`
- Install plugin https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ValeryanM.vscode-phpsab

## How to use php codesniffer

List errors and warnings:

```bash
phpcs /path/to/code/myfile.php # lint specific file
phpcs # be in plugin root and all files will be linted
npm run lint-php # or use npm script
```

Fix things:

```
