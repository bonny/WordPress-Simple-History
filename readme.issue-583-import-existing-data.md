# Issue #583: Generate history based on existing WP data

**Status**: Testing & Review
**Branch**: `issue-583-import-existing-data`
**Issue URL**: https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/583
**Code Quality**: ✅ phpcs passed, ✅ phpstan passed

## Summary

✅ **Core functionality implemented and working**

This feature provides a way to import existing WordPress data into Simple History, populating the log with historical events from before the plugin was activated. The implementation is accessible through an "Experimental Features" admin page where users can manually trigger imports with configurable options.

**What's Working**:
- Import posts and pages with creation and modification dates
- Import users with registration dates
- Configurable post type selection
- Adjustable import limits (1-1000 items per type)
- Proper message formatting matching existing loggers
- Historical date preservation using `_date` context
- Duplicate prevention - automatically skips already-imported items
- Debug tracking for troubleshooting with detailed skip reporting

## Overview

When the plugin is installed it contains no history at all - an empty state that's not very useful. This feature aims to populate the log with historical data from the WordPress installation after the plugin is activated.

The information available in WordPress for historical events is limited, but we can pull in:
- Post and page changes (modification dates, authors)
- User registration dates
- Any public post types available in WordPress

## Goals

**Original Goals**:
- ~~Import existing post/page data into Simple History on first activation~~
- Provide a better initial experience for new users
- Show historical context even for events that occurred before plugin installation

**Implemented Approach**:
- Manual import via Experimental Features admin page (not automatic on activation)
- User-controlled import with configurable options
- Transparent process allowing users to test on different sites first

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Sources

Available WordPress data to import:
- Posts/Pages: `post_date`, `post_modified`, `post_author`, `post_status`
- Comments: `comment_date`, `comment_approved`
- Users: `user_registered`
- Options: Limited historical data
- Media: Upload dates and modifications

### Technical Approach

- Detect first-time installation vs. existing installation
- Run import process on plugin activation or as admin action
- Import in batches to avoid timeouts
- Consider performance impact on large sites
- Provide UI feedback during import

### Questions & Answers

- ✅ **Should this run automatically on activation or require user action?**
  - **Answer**: Requires user action via Experimental Features page. Avoids performance issues and gives users control.

- ✅ **How far back should we import data?**
  - **Answer**: Configurable limit (1-1000 items per type). Users control the scope.

- ✅ **Should users be able to configure what gets imported?**
  - **Answer**: Yes. Users can select specific post types and choose whether to import users.

- ⚠️ **How to handle large sites with thousands of posts?**
  - **Current**: Import limit prevents immediate timeouts
  - **Future**: Could add batch processing/AJAX for very large datasets

- ✅ **Should this be a one-time import or repeatable?**
  - **Answer**: Repeatable. Users can safely run it multiple times - duplicate detection automatically skips already-imported items.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The import functionality has been implemented as an **experimental feature** accessible through an admin page, rather than running automatically on activation. This approach:

- Allows users to test the functionality on different sites
- Avoids potential performance issues on large sites during activation
- Provides transparency about what data is being imported
- Gives users control over when and what to import

### Files Created

1. **`inc/class-existing-data-importer.php`**
   - Core importer class responsible for importing historical data
   - Handles posts, pages, and users
   - Uses Simple History's logger infrastructure to create entries with historical dates
   - Supports configurable limits and post types

2. **`inc/services/class-experimental-features-page.php`**
   - Service class that adds an "Experimental Features" admin page
   - Auto-discovered by Simple History (placed in `/inc/services/`)
   - Provides UI for triggering imports
   - Handles form submission and displays results

### Key Features

- **Post Type Selection**: Users can choose which post types to import
- **Configurable Limits**: Import limit (1-1000 items per type) to prevent timeouts
- **User Import**: Optional import of user registration dates
- **Historical Dates**: Uses original `post_date_gmt` and `post_modified_gmt` for accurate history
- **Proper Initiator**: Sets initiator to `OTHER` to distinguish imported events from real-time events
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically detects and skips already-imported items using batch SQL queries
- **Import Tracking**: Displays counts of imported and skipped items with detailed debugging

### Technical Approach

The importer:
1. Queries WordPress for existing posts/users
2. Uses the appropriate logger (Post_Logger, User_Logger)
3. Logs entries with custom dates using the `_date` context key
4. Respects post status (publish, draft, pending, private)
5. Logs both creation and modification events if dates differ
6. Returns detailed tracking data for debugging purposes

### Logger Integration

The importer correctly uses Simple History's logger infrastructure:

**Post Import** (`inc/class-existing-data-importer.php:110-143`):
- Uses `Post_Logger->info_message('post_created', $context)`
- Uses `Post_Logger->info_message('post_updated', $context)` if modification date differs
- Context includes: `post_id`, `post_type`, `post_title`, `_date`, `_initiator`, `_imported_event`

**User Import** (`inc/class-existing-data-importer.php:181-194`):
- Uses `User_Logger->info_message('user_created', $context)`
- Context matches User_Logger format exactly:
  - `created_user_id`, `created_user_login`, `created_user_email`
  - `created_user_first_name`, `created_user_last_name`, `created_user_url`
  - `created_user_role` (comma-separated if multiple roles)
  - `_date`, `_initiator`, `_imported_event`
- Displays as: "Created user {login} ({email}) with role {role}"

**Imported Event Marker**:
- All imported events include `_imported_event => true` in their context
- This allows programmatic identification and filtering of imported events
- Follows existing Simple History pattern (similar to `_xmlrpc_request`, `_rest_api_request`)
- Enables future features like filtering UI, duplicate detection, and analytics
- No GUI changes required - stored silently in database context table

### Duplicate Prevention

**Implementation** (`inc/class-existing-data-importer.php:287-352`):

The importer uses batch SQL queries to detect already-imported items before processing:

**For Posts**:
- Queries for all post IDs in the current batch
- Checks separately for `post_created` and `post_updated` events
- Smart skip logic: only skips if ALL applicable events exist
- Example: If a post was never modified, only checks for `post_created` event

**For Users**:
- Queries for all user IDs in the current batch
- Checks for existing `user_created` events
- Skips users that have already been imported

**Performance**:
- Only 2 SQL queries total per import (one for posts, one for users)
- Uses batch checking with IN clauses instead of N individual queries
- Leverages `_imported_event` context marker for reliable detection

**User Experience**:
- First import: "Imported 100 posts and 20 users into the history log."
- Subsequent import: "Imported 0 posts (skipped 100 already imported) and 0 users (skipped 20 already imported)."
- Page description updated to: "You can run this import multiple times. Items that have already been imported will be automatically skipped to prevent duplicates."

### Debug Tracking

The importer returns detailed results including:
- `posts_imported`: Total count of posts imported
- `users_imported`: Total count of users imported
- `posts_skipped`: Total count of posts skipped (already imported)
- `users_skipped`: Total count of users skipped (already imported)
- `posts_details`: Array with full details of each imported post (ID, title, type, status, dates, events logged)
- `users_details`: Array with full details of each imported user (ID, login, email, registration date, roles)
- `skipped_details`: Array with details of skipped items (type, ID, title/login, reason)
- `errors`: Array of any errors encountered

Debug output is logged via `error_log()` in `inc/services/class-experimental-features-page.php:220-223`

## Findings

### WordPress Data Available for Import

- **Posts/Pages**:
  - `post_date_gmt`: Creation date
  - `post_modified_gmt`: Last modification date
  - Both dates are available and accurate
  - Can distinguish between creation and updates

- **Users**:
  - `user_registered`: Registration timestamp
  - Available for all users

- **Limitations**:
  - No historical data for who made changes
  - No detailed change information (what was changed)
  - Cannot determine the number of times a post was edited
  - Authors in `post_author` field may no longer exist

### Menu Page System

- Simple History uses a sophisticated Menu Manager + Menu Page pattern
- Services in `/inc/services/` are auto-discovered
- Menu pages can be placed in different locations based on settings
- The `Menu_Page` class provides a fluent API for page creation

### Test Results

Initial testing on a development site:
- ✅ Successfully imported 96 posts/pages
- ✅ Successfully imported 22 users
- ✅ Historical dates preserved correctly
- ✅ Both creation and modification events logged for posts
- ✅ User registration messages display correctly with proper format
- ✅ No timeouts or performance issues with dataset size
- ✅ Debug logging works correctly for troubleshooting
- ✅ Duplicate prevention works correctly - re-running import skips all items
- ✅ Skipped counts display correctly in UI
- ⚠️ Edge cases discovered:
  - Posts with `0000-00-00 00:00:00` dates handled gracefully
  - Future scheduled posts imported correctly
  - Empty date fields don't cause errors

### Known Issues & Fixes

1. **User registration message format** (FIXED)
   - **Issue**: Initially used generic `info()` method with custom message
   - **Fix**: Changed to `info_message('user_created', $context)` with proper context parameters
   - **Location**: `inc/class-existing-data-importer.php:181-194`
   - **Result**: Messages now display as "Created user {login} ({email}) with role {role}"

2. **Service namespace import** (FIXED)
   - **Issue**: Incorrect namespace `use Simple_History\Service;`
   - **Fix**: Changed to `use Simple_History\Services\Service;`
   - **Location**: `inc/services/class-experimental-features-page.php:8`

3. **Security - Input sanitization** (FIXED)
   - **Issue**: Missing proper escaping and unslashing for POST/GET data
   - **Fix**: Added `sanitize_text_field()` and `wp_unslash()` for all user inputs
   - **Location**: `inc/services/class-experimental-features-page.php:190-202`

### Known Limitations

1. **Date ordering issue** (See Issue #584)
   - **Issue**: Imported events have high primary key IDs but old dates
   - **Impact**: When importing old data into a site with existing history, imported events appear at the top (by ID) instead of chronologically
   - **Example**: Import 2020 events into site with 2024 events → 2020 events show first (wrong order)
   - **Root Cause**: Simple History orders by `id DESC` not `date DESC` due to occasions grouping requirements
   - **Status**: Separate issue tracked in #584 to implement date ordering option
   - **Workaround**: Import historical data before plugin accumulates new events, or wait for #584 implementation
   - **Related File**: `readme.issue-584-date-ordering.md`
