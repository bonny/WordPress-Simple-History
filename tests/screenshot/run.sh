# Capture wordpress.org marketing assets — screenshot-1.png … -11.png plus
# banner-1544x500.png / -772x250.png — by booting a clean WordPress Playground,
# populating curated events via the blueprint, and running Playwright specs
# against it. Each spec under tests/playwright/screenshot-*.spec.js owns one
# image. The banner spec doesn't need the Playground (it renders a local HTML
# mockup over file://); when only the banner is requested, Playground boot
# is skipped to save ~30s.
#
# Usage:
#   bash tests/screenshot/run.sh                  # capture everything
#   bash tests/screenshot/run.sh banner           # only the banner pair
#   bash tests/screenshot/run.sh banner playground  # specific specs
#   npm run screenshot -- banner                  # same, via npm
#
# Spec names match the bit after `screenshot-` in the file name:
#   playground, banner, inline-diff, user-events, plugin-install,
#   event-details, ip-popover, insights-widget, stats-page,
#   dashboard-widget, email-settings, email-preview, compact-view
