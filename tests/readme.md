# Tests

-   Tests use [wpbrowser](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/).
-   Tests are run using Docker.
-   Install required composer dependencies with `$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli composer install`.
-   Copy `dump.sql` to `tests/_data/dump.sql`.
    -   This is the starting database fixture, containing the WordPress state that the tests start from. It's a minimal, starting environment shared by all tests. The file is not included in the repo.
-   Copy `twentysixteen.2.6.zip` and `twentysixteen.2.7.zip` to `tests/_data/twentysixteen.2.6.zip` and `tests/_data/twentysixteen.2.7.zip`.
-   Manually download [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) and [WP Crontrol](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/) and place in `tests/plugins`. The plugins are are used to test that Simple History catches changes in those plugins.
-   Start containers required for testing:
    `$ docker compose up -d`.
    This will start **WordPress**, **MariaDB** and a **Headless Chrome** using Selenium.
-   Run _unit_, _acceptance_, and _functional_ tests using PHP 7.4:
    -   `$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run wpunit`
        -   Faster tests to test things that does not require so much user input.
    -   `$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance`
        -   These are tests that are performed using a Chromium browser, like it was done with users that actually visits the WP admin in a browser and does things. These test are slower but more realistic.
        -   To run a single test run for example
            `$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance SimpleUserLoggerCest:logUserCreated` or to run a single suite
            `$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance SimpleUserLoggerCest`
    -   `‚ùØ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run functional`
    -   Run single test:
        -   `docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance FirstCest:visitPluginPage`

## Run a single test

To run for example `UserCest:logUserProfileUpdated`:

`$ docker-compose run --rm php-cli vendor/bin/codecept run acceptance UserCest:logUserProfileUpdated`

## Setting up the starting database fixture

The `dump.sql` file is generating something like this:

```sh
# Install WordPress
docker-compose run --rm wp-cli wp core install --version=6.1 --url=localhost:8080 --title=wp-tests --admin_user=admin --admin_email=test@example.com --admin_password=admin --skip-email

# Empty site (removes post etc.)
docker-compose run --rm wp-cli wp site empty --yes --uploads

# Activate plugin
docker-compose run --rm wp-cli plugin activate simple-history

# Export database to local file
docker-compose run --rm wp-cli wp db export - > db-export-`date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M"`.sql
```

## Modify installation using browser

To modify installed WordPress version using a web browser, to for example update WordPress or update plugins:

```sh
# Restore DB so can browse from localhost:9191 again, perhaps to update the fixture.
# Note: to update WP you need to temporary disable mu-plugin.php. (Is this still true?)

docker compose run --rm wp-cli db import /var/www/html/tests/_data/dump.sql
docker compose run --rm wp-cli option set siteurl http://localhost:9191
docker compose run --rm wp-cli option set home http://localhost:9191

# Go to http://localhost:9191 and make changes
# Login using http://localhost:9191/wp-login.php and use admin/admin.

# Then export sql file again:
docker compose run --rm wp-cli wp db export - > db-export-`date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H_%M"`.sql

# Replace the old dump.sql with the new one
# I.e. rename the new one to dump.sql and remove the old one.
```

## Update log

## Clean install of WordPress for tests

-   docker compose up
-   wp running on localhost:9191 but it thinks its on port 80 (because thats the internal port)
-   access at http://localhost:9191/wp-login.php
-   ...forgot the rest.. update this next time I need to do it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
