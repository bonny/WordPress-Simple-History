# Changelog for 2015 an earlier

= 2.13 (November 2016) =

- Added filter `simple_history_log` that is a simplified way to add message to the log, without the need to check for the existence of Simple History or its SimpleLogger function. Use it like this: `apply_filters("simple_history_log", "This is a logged message");` See the [examples file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for more examples.
- IP info now displays a popup with map + geolocation info for users using HTTPS again. Thanks to the great https://twitter.com/ipinfoio for letting all users use their service :)
- Fix notice warning for missing `$data_parent_row`

= 2.12 (September 2016) =

- You can show a different number of log items in the log on the dashboard and on the dedicated history page. By default the dashboard will show 5 items and the page will show 30.
- On multisites the user search filter now only search users in the current site.
- The statistics chart using Chart.js now uses the namespace window.Simple_History_Chart instead of window.Chart, decreasing the risk that two versions of the Chart.js library overwriting each others. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/comet-cache-breaks-simple-history/. (Note to future me: this was fixed by renaming the `window.chart` variable to `window.chart.Simple_history_chart` in the line `window.Chart = module.exports = Chart;`)
- If spam comments are logged they are now included in the log. Change made to make sql query shorter and easier. Should not actually show any spam comments anyway because we don't log them since version 2.5.5 anyway. If you want to revert this behavior for some reason you can use the filter `simple_history/comments_logger/include_spam`.

= 2.11 (September 2016) =

- Added support for plugin [Redirection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/).
  Redirects and groups that are created, changed, enabled and disabled will be logged. Also when the plugin global settings are changed that will be logged.
- Fix possible notice error from User logger.
- "View changelog" link now works on multisite.

= 2.10 (September 2016) =

- Available updates to plugins, themes, and WordPress itself is now logged.
  Pretty great if you subscribe to the RSS feed to get the changes on a site. No need to manually check the updates-page to see if there are any updates.
- Changed to logic used to determine if a post edit should be logged or not. Version 2.9 used a version that started to log a bit to much for some plugins. This should fix the problems with the Nextgen Gallery, All-In-One Events Calendar, and Membership 2 plugins. If you still have problems with a plugin that is causing to many events to be logged, please let me know!

= 2.9.1 (August 2016) =

- Fixed an issue where the logged time was off by some hours, due to timezone being manually set elsewhere.
  Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/logged-time-off-by-2-hours and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/different-time-between-dashboard-and-logger.
- Fixed Nextgen Gallery and Nextgen Gallery Plus logging lots and lots of event when viewing posts with galleries. The posts was actually updated, so this plugin did nothing wrong. But it was indeed a bit annoying and most likely something you didn't want in your log. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/non-stop-logging-nextgen-gallery-items.

= 2.9 (August 2016) =

- Added custom date ranges to the dates filter. Just select "Custom date range..." in the dates dropdown and you can choose to see the log between any two exact dates.
- The values in the statistics graph can now be clicked and when clicked the log is filtered to only show logged events from that day. Very convenient if you have a larger number of events logged for one day and quickly want to find out what exactly was logged that day.
- Dates filter no longer accepts multi values. It was indeed a bit confusing that you could select both "Last 7 days" and "Last 3 days".
- Fix for empty previous plugin version (the `{plugin_prev_version}` placeholder) when updating plugins.
- Post and pages updates done in the WordPress apps for Ios and Android should be logged again.

= 2.8 (August 2016) =

- Theme installs are now logged
- ...and so are theme updates
- ...and theme deletions. Awesome!
- Support for plugin [Limit Login Attempts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-login-attempts/).
  Failed login attempts, lockouts and configuration changes will be logged.
- Correct message is now used when a plugin update fails, i.e. the message for key `plugin_update_failed`.
- The original untranslated strings for plugin name and so on are stored when storing info for plugin installs and updates and similar.
- Default number of events to show is now 10 instead of 5.

= 2.7.5 (August 2016) =

- User logins using e-mail are now logged correctly. Previously the user would be logged in successfully but the log said that they failed.
- Security fix: only users with [`list_users`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities#list_users) capability can view the users filter and use the autocomplete api for users.
  Previously the autocomplete function could be used by all logged in users.
- Add labels to search filters. (I do really hate label-less forms so it's kinda very strange that this was not in place before.)
- Misc other internal fixes

= 2.7.4 (July 2016) =

- Log a warning message if a plugin gets disabled automatically by WordPress because of any of these errors: "Plugin file does not exist.", "Invalid plugin path.", "The plugin does not have a valid header."
- Fix warning error if `on_wp_login()` was called without second argument.
- Fix options diff not being shown correctly.
- Fix notice if no message key did exist for a log message.

= 2.7.3 (June 2016) =

- Removed the usage of the mb\_\* functions and mbstring is no longer a requirement.
- Added a new debug tab to the settings page. On the debug page you can see stuff like how large your database is and how many rows that are stored in the database. Also, a list of all loggers are listed there together with some useful (for developers anyway) information.

= 2.7.2 (June 2016) =

- Fixed message about mbstring required not being echo'ed.
- Fixed notice errors for users not allowed to view the log.

= 2.7.1 (June 2016) =

- Added: Add shortcut to history in Admin bar for current site and in Network Admin Bar for each site where plugin is installed. Can be disabled using filters `simple_history/add_admin_bar_menu_item` and `simple_history/add_admin_bar_network_menu_item`.
- Added: Add check that [´mbstring´](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) is enabled and show a warning if it's not.
- Changed: Changes to "Front Page Displays" in "Reading Settings" now show the name of the old and new page (before only id was logged).
- Changed: Changes to "Default Post Category" and "Default Mail Category" in "Writing Settings" now show the name of the old and new category (before only id was logged).
- Fixed: When changing "Front Page Displays" in "Reading Settings" the option "rewrite_rules" also got logged.
- Fixed: Changes in Permalink Settings were not logged correctly.
- Fixed: Actions done with [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) was not correctly attributed. Now the log should say "WP-CLI" instead of "Other" for actions done in WP CLI.

= 2.7 (May 2016) =

- Added: When a user is created or edited the log now shows what fields have changed and from what old value to what new value. A much requested feature!
- Fixed: If you edited your own profile the log would say that you edited "their profile". Now it says that you edited "your profile" instead.
- Changed: Post diffs could get very tall. Now they are max approx 8 rows by default, but if you hover the diff (or give it focus with your keyboard) you get a scrollbar and can scroll the contents. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dashboard-max-length-of-content and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/feature-request-make-content-diff-report-expandable-and-closed-by-default.
- Fixed: Maybe fix a notice warning if a transient was missing a name or value.

= 2.6 (May 2016) =

- Added: A nice little graph in the sidebar that displays the number of logged events per day the last 28 days. Graph is powered by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/).
- Added: Function `get_num_events_last_n_days()`
- Added: Function `get_num_events_per_day_last_n_days()`
- Changed: Switched to transients from cache at some places, because more people will benefit from transients instead of cache (that requires object cache to be installed).
- Changed: New constant `SETTINGS_GENERAL_OPTION_GROUP`. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/constant-for-settings-option-group-name-option_group.
- Fixed: Long log messages with no spaces would get cut of. Now all the message is shown, but with one or several line breaks. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/pull/112.
- Fixed: Some small CSS modification to make the page less "jumpy" while loading (for example setting a default height to the select2 input box).

= 2.5.5 (April 2016) =

- Changed: The logger for Enable Media Replace required the capability `edit_files` to view the logged events, but since this also made it impossible to view events if the constant `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` was true. Now Enable Media Replace requires the capability `upload_files` instead. Makes more sense. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-history-and-disallow_file_edit.
- Changed: No longer log spam trackbacks or comments. Before this version these where logged, but not shown.
- Fixed: Translations was not loaded for Select2. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/found-a-string-thats-not-translatable-v-254.
- Fixed: LogQuery `date_to`-argument was using `date_from`.
- Changed: The changelog for 2015 and earlier are now moved to [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

= 2.5.4 (March 2016) =

- Added: Support for new key in info array from logger: "name_via". Set this value in a logger and the string will be shown next to the date of the logged event. Useful when logging actions from third party plugins, or any kind of other logging that is not from WordPress core.
- Added: Method `getInfoValueByKey` added to the SimpleLogger class, for easier retrieval of values from the info array of a logger.
- Fixed: Themes could no be deleted. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/98 and https://wordpress.org/support/topic/deleting-theme-1.
- Fixed: Notice error when generating permalink for event.
- Fixed: Removed a `console.log()`.
- Changed: Check that array key is integer or string. Hopefully fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/error-in-wp-adminerror_log.

= 2.5.3 (February 2016) =

- Fixed: Old entries was not correctly removed. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/108.

= 2.5.2 (February 2016) =

- Added: The GUI log now updates the relative "fuzzy" timestamps in real time. This means that if you keep the log opened, the relative date for each event, for example "2 minutes ago" or "2 hours ago", will always be up to date (hah!). Keep the log opened for 5 minutes and you will see that the event that previously said "2 minutes ago" now says "7 minutes ago". Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/88 and is implemented using the great [timeago jquery plugin](http://timeago.yarp.com/).
- Added: Filter `simple_history/user_logger/plain_text_output_use_you`. Works the same way as the `simple_history/header_initiator_use_you` filter, but for the rich text part when a user has edited their profile.
- Fixed: Logger slugs that contained for example backslashes (because they where namespaced) would not show up in the log. Now logger slugs are escaped. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/103.
- Changed: Actions and things that only is needed in admin area are now only called if `is_admin()`. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/105.

= 2.5.1 (February 2016) =

- Fixed: No longer assume that the ajaxurl don't already contains query params. Should fix problems with third party plugins like [WPML](https://wpml.org/).
- Fixed: Notice if context key did not exist. Should fix https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/100.
- Fixed: Name and title on dashboard and settings page were not translateable. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dashboard-max-length-of-content.
- Fixed: Typo when user resets password.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_date_output`.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/log/inserted`.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/row_header_date_output`.

= 2.5 (December 2015) =

- Added: Category edits are now logged, so now you can see terms, categories and taxonomies that are added, changed, and deleted. Fixes for example https://wordpress.org/support/topic/view-changes-to-categories and https://twitter.com/hmarafi/status/655994402037362688.
- Fixed: The media logger now shows the width and height of uploaded images again.
- Fixed: IP Lookup using ipinfo.io would fail if your site was using HTTPS (pro account on ipinfo.io required for that), so now falls back to opening a link to ipinfo.io in a new tab instead.
- Fixed: If there was a server error while loading the log, the error would be shown, to help you debug any errors. The error would however not go away if you successfully loaded the log again. Now it does.
- Changed: The search/filter now falls back to showing events for the last 14 days, if 30 days would return over 1000 pages of events. This change is to try to make the log fail to load in less scenarios. If a site got a bit spike if brute force attacks (yes, it's always those attacks!) then there could be a big jump in the number of events and pages between 14 days and 30 days.
- Changed: Failed login attempts now use shorter messages and shorter variable names. Not really the fault of this plugin, but sites can get a huge amount of failed login attempts logged. Sites with almost 2 million logged rows just in the last 60 days for example. And that will cause the database tables with the history to grow to several hundreds of megabyte. So to make those tables a bit smaller the plugin now uses shorter messages for failed login attempts, shorter variable names, and it stores less data. If you want to stop hackers from attacking your site (resulting in big history logs) you should install a plugin like [Jetpack and its BruteProtect module](https://jetpack.me/support/security-features/).
- Updated: Added date filter to show just events from just one day. Useful for sites that get hammered by brute force login attempts. On one site where I had 166434 login attempts the last 7 days this helped to make the log actually load :/.
- Updated: New French translation

= 2.4 (November 2015) =

- Added: Now logs when a user changes their password using the "reset password" link.
- Added: Now logs when a user uses the password reset form.
- Added: New method `register_dropin` that can be used to add dropins.
- Added: New action `simple_history/add_custom_dropin`.
- Added: Example on how to add an external dropin: [example-dropin.php](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-dropin.php).
- Added: "Last day" added to filter, because a brute force attack can add so many logs that it's not possible to fetch a whole week.
- Changed: Filter `simple_history/log/do_log` now pass 5 arguments instead of 3. Before this update in was not possible for multiple add_action()-calls to use this filter, because you would not now if any other code had canceled it and so on. If you have been using this filter you need to modify your code.
- Changed: When hovering the time of an event in the log, the date of the event displays in both local time and GMT time. Hopefully makes it easier for admins in different timezones that work together on a site to understand when each event happened. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/84.
- Fixed: Line height was a bit tight on the dashboard. Also: the margin was a tad to small for the first logged event on the dashboard.
- Fixed: Username was not added correctly to failed login attempts when using plugin Captcha on Login + it would still show that a user logged out sometimes when a bot/script brute force attacked a site by only sending login and password and not the captcha field.

= 2.3.1 (October 2015) =

- Fixed: Hopefully fixed the wrong relative time, as reported here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wrong-reporting-time.
- Changed: The RSS-feed with updates is now disabled by default for new installs. It is password protected, but some users felt that is should be optional to activate it. And now it is! Thanks to https://github.com/guillaumemolter for adding this feature.
- Fixed: Failed login entries when using plugin [Captcha on Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha-on-login/) was reported as "Logged out" when they really meant "Failed to log in". Please note that this was nothing that Simple History did wrong, it was rather Captcha on Login that manually called `wp_logout()` each time a user failed to login. Should fix all those mystery "Logged out"-entried some of you users had.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/log/do_log` that can be used to shortcut the log()-method.
- Updated: German translation updated.

= 2.3 (October 2015) =

- Added: The title of the browser tab with Simple History open will now show the number of new and unread events available. Nice feature to have if you keep a tab with the Simple History log open but in the background: now you can see directly in the title if new events are available. Such small change. Very much nice.
- Added: If the AJAX call to fetch the log failed, a message now appears telling the user that something went wrong. Also, the output from the server is displayed so they can get a hint of what's going wrong. Hopefully this will reduce the number of support requests that is caused by other plugins.
- Fixed: Edited posts/pages/custom post types does not get a linked title unless the user viewing the log has edit rights.
- Fixed: Another try to fix the notice error here: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.
- Updated: Danish translation updated.
- Updated: POT file updated.

= 2.2.4 (September 2015) =

- Added: Basic support for plugin [Ultimate Member](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-member/), so users logging in using the plugin will now be logged in Simple History. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/compatibility-with-ultimate-member.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/logger/interpolate/context` that can be used to modify the variables sent to the message template.
- Changed: Remove "type" key from context detail table, because it's an old an unused column.
- Changed: During a first install the plugin now creates a few less columns than before (some columns where left from version 1 of the plugin).
- Changed: Don't show the "translate this plugin" metabox for any english talking locale.
- Changed: Don't show the GitHub metabox.
- Fixed: If the plugin is deleted (but why?!) then the context table is also removed now.
- Behind the scenes: More unit tests! Hopefully more nasty things will get caught before releasing new versions of the plugin.

= 2.2.3 (September 2015) =

- Fixed: On new installs the database tables was not created correctly and new events could not be logged.

= 2.2.2 (September 2015) =

- Fixed: Logging stopped working for languages other then English. Sorry about that!
- Fixed: When running unit tests for a site where Simple History is a must use plugin it sometimes tried to create tables and add columns more then once. Now uses `if not exists` and similar to only try to create the tables if they not already exists.

= 2.2.1 (September 2015) =

- Fixed: Missed to log users switching back on using the User Switching plugin. Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/89.

= 2.2 (September 2015) =

- Added: Support for plugin [User Switching](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-switching/). The event log will show when a user switched to another user, when they switched back, or when they switched off.
- Added: Support for plugin [Enable Media Replace](https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-media-replace/). Whenever a user replaces an attachment with a new, you will now know about it and also see the name of both the old and the new attachment. Awesome!
- Fixed: Mouse over (:hover state) on buttons no longer use blue background. Now works much better with admin themes other than the standard one. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pagination-button-design.

= 2.1.7 (September 2015) =

- Fixed: Date and time in the log was using GMT time rather than local time. Could be confusing. Even very confusing if living in a time zone far far away from the GMT zone.

= 2.1.6 (August 2015) =

- Updated: Danish translation updated. Thanks translator!
- Fixed: Icon on settings page was a bit unaligned on WordPress not running the latest beta version (hrm, which I guess most of you were..)
- Fixed: Possible php notice. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simplehistoryphp-creates-debug-entries.
- Changed: Logged messages are now trimmed by default (spaces and new lines will be removed from messages).
- Updated: When installing and activating the plugin it will now add the same "plugin installed" and "plugin activated" message that other plugins get when they are installed. These events where not logged before because the plugin was not installed and could therefore not log its own installation. Solution was to log it manually. Works. Looks good. But perhaps a bit of cheating.
- Added: A (hopefully) better welcome message when activating the plugin for the first time. Hopefully the new message makes new users understand a bit better why the log may be empty at first.

= 2.1.5 (August 2015) =

- Fixed: It was not possible to modify the filters `simple_history/view_settings_capability` and `simple_history/view_history_capability` from the `functions.php`-file in a theme (filters where applied too early - they did however work from within a plugin!)
- Changed: Use `h1` instead of `h2` on admin screens. Reason for this the changes in 4.3: https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/.
- Removed: the constant `VERSION` is now removed. Use constant `SIMPLE_HISTORY_VERSION` instead of you need to check the current version of Simple History.

= 2.1.4 (July 2015) =

- Fixed: WordPress core updates got the wrong previous version.
- Updated: Updated German translations.
- Added: GHU header added to plugin header, to support [GitHub Updater plugin](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater).

= 2.1.3 (July 2015) =

- Fixed: Ajax error when loading a log that contained uploaded images.
- Fixed: Removed some debug log messages.

= 2.1.2 (July 2015) =

- Changed: By default the log now shows events from the last week, last two weeks or last 30 days, all depending on how many events you have in your log. The previous behavior was to not apply any filtering what so ever during the first load. Anyway: this change makes it possible to load the log very quickly even for very large logs. A large amount of users + keeping the log forever = millions of rows of data. Previously this could stall the log or make it load almost forever. Now = almost always very fast. I have tried it with over 5.000 users and a million row and yes - zing! - much faster. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/load-with-pagination-mysql.
- Added: Finnish translation. Thanks a lot to the translator!
- Updated: Swedish translation updated
- Added: Cache is used on a few more places.
- Added: Plugin now works as a ["must-use-plugin"](https://codex.wordpress.org/Must_Use_Plugins). Props [jacquesletesson](https://github.com/jacquesletesson).
- Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/show_more_filters_on_load` that is used to control if the search options should be expanded by default when the history page is loaded. Default is false, to have a less cluttered GUI.
- Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_user_ids` that is used to search/filter specific user ids by default (no need to search and select users). Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-pass-array-of-user-ids-to-history-query.
- Added: Filter `SimpleHistoryFilterDropin/filter_default_loglevel` that is used to search/filter for log levels by default.
- Fixed: if trying to log an array or an object the logger now automagically runs `json_encode()` on the value to make it a string. Previously is just tried to run `$wpdb->insert() with the array and that gave errors. Should fix https://wordpress.org/support/topic/mysql_real_escape_string.
- Fixed: The function that checks for new rows each second (or actually each tenth second to spare resources) was called an extra time each time the submit button for the filter was clicked. Kinda stupid. Kinda fixed now.
- Fixed: The export feature that was added in version 2.1 was actually not enabled for all users. Now it is!
- Fixed: Image attachments that is deleted from file system no longer result in "broken image" in the log. (Rare case, I know, but it does happen for me that local dev server and remote prod server gets out of "sync" when it comes to attachments.)

= 2.1.1 (May 2015) =

- Removed: filter `simple_history/dropins_dir` removed.
- Changed: Dropins are not loaded from a `glob()` call anymore (just like plugins in the prev release)
- Updated: Brazilian Portuguese translation updated.
- Fixed: POT file updated for translators.
- Fixed: Better sanitization of API arguments.

= 2.1 (May 2015) =

- Added: Export! Now it's possible to export the events log to a JSON or CSV formatted file. It's your data so you should be able to export it any time you want or need. And now you can do that. You will find the export function in the Simple History settings page (Settings -> Simple History).
- Added: Filter `simple_history/add_custom_logger` and function `register_logger` that together are used to load external custom loggers. See [example-logger.php](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/example-logger.php) for usage example.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/header_initiator_use_you`.
- Fixed: Fixed an undefined variable in get_avatar(). Fixes https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/issues/74.
- Fixed: When using [HyperDB](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/hyperdb) only one event was returned. Fixed by using [adding `NO_SELECT_FOUND_ROWS` to the query](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/hyperdb/trunk/db.php?#L49). Should fix problems for users using HyperDB and also users using for example [wpengine.com](http://wpengine.com) (that probably also is using HyperDB or a similar approach).
- Changed: Loggers now get default capability "manage_options" if they have no capability set.
- Changed: Misc internal cleanup.
- Removed: filter `simple_history/loggers_dir` removed, because loggers are loaded from array instead of file listing generated from `glob()`. Should be (however to the eye non-noticeable) faster.

= 2.0.30 (May 2015) =

- Added: Username of logged events now link to that user's profile.
- Fixed: When expanding occasion the first loaded occasion was the same event as the one you expanded from, and the last occasions was missing. Looked extra stupid when only 1 occasion existed, and you clicked "show occasions" only to just find the same event again. So stupid. But fixed now!
- Fixed: If an event had many similar events the list of similar events could freeze the browser. ([17948 failed login attempts overnight](https://twitter.com/eskapism/status/595478847598002176) is not that uncommon it turns out!)
- Fixed: Some loggers were missing the "All"-message in the search.
- Changed: Hide some more keys and values by default in the context data popup.
- Changed: Use `truncate` instead of `delete` when clearing the database. Works much faster on large logs.

= 2.0.29 (April 2015) =

- Added: Introducing [Post "Quick Diff"](http://eskapism.se/blog/2015/04/quick-diff-shows-post-changes-in-wordpress/) – a very simple and efficient way to quickly see what’s been changed in a post. With Quick Diff you will in a glance see the difference between the title, permalink, content, publish date, post status, post author, or the template of the post. It's really a super simple and fast way to follow the work of your co-editors.
- Added: Filter to add custom HTML above and after the context data table. They are named `simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_before_context_table` and `simple_history/log_html_output_details_single/html_after_context_table` (and yes, I do fancy really long filter names).
- Added: Filters to control what to output in the data/context details table (the popup you see when you click the time of each event): `simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/row_keys_to_show` and `simple_history/log_html_output_details_table/context_keys_to_show`. Also added [two usage examples](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for the filters.
- Added: Filter `simple_history/log_insert_context` to control what gets saved to the context table. Example on usage for this is also available in the [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php).
- Added: data attribute `data-ip-address-multiple` and class `SimpleHistoryLogitem--IPAddress-multiple` added for events that have more than one IP address detected. Happens when `http_x_forwarded_for` or similar headers are included in response.
- Updated: Danish translation updated.
- Fixed: Images in GitHub readme files are now displayed correctly.
- Fixed: Readme files to GitHub repositories ending with slash (/) now works correctly too.
- Fixed: IP Info popup is now again closeable with `ESC` key or with a click outside it.
- Fixed: Some enqueued scripts had double slashes in them.
- Fixed: Make sure [URLs from add_query_arg() gets escaped](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/).

- Changed: Misc small design fixes.

= 2.0.23 (March 2015) =

- Added: Filter `simple_history/rss_item_link`, so plugins can modify the link used in the RSS feed.
- Added: Links for changed posts and attachments in RSS feed now links directly to WordPress admin, making is easier to follow things from your RSS reeder.
- Added: Filters to hide history dashboard widget and history dashboard page. Filters are `simple_history/show_dashboard_widget` and `simple_history/show_dashboard_page`.
- Fixed: A missing argument error when deleting a plugin. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/warning-missing-argument-1-for-simplepluginlogger.

= 2.0.22 (February 2015) =

- Fixed: Deleted plugins were not logged correctly (name and other info was missing).
- Added: Filter `simple_history/logger/load_logger` and `simple_history/dropin/load_dropin` that can be used to control the loading of each logger or dropin. See [example file](https://github.com/bonny/WordPress-Simple-History/blob/master/examples/examples.php) for usage examples.

- Changed: RSS feed now has loglevel of event prepended to the title.

- Added: If constant `SIMPLE_HISTORY_LOG_DEBUG` is defined and true automatically adds `$_GET`, `$_POST`, and more info to each logged event. Mostly useful for the developer, but maybe some of you are a bit paranoid and want it too.
- Updated: German translation updated.

= 2.0.20 (February 2015) =

- Added: changes via [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org) is now detected (was previously shown as "other").

= 2.0.18 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: really correctly show the version number of the previous version!

= 2.0.17 (January 2015) =

- Added: messages added using for example `SimpleLogger()->info( __("My log message") )` that have translations now auto translated the message back to english before storing the message (together with the text domain). Then upon retrieval it uses the english message + the text domain to translate the message to the currently selected language. This makes it easier to make multilingual log entries. (Yeah, I know its hard to understand what the heck this does, but it's something good and cool, trust me!)
- Added: A sidebar with text contents on the history page.
- Changed: Search now shows only the search box by default, with a link to show all search options.

= 2.0.16 (January 2015) =

- Fixed: Use the [X-Forwarded-For header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Forwarded-For), if it is set, to determine remote IP address. Should now correctly store IP addresses for servers behind load balancers or for clients going through proxies. Fixes https://wordpress.org/support/topic/use-x-forwarded-for-http-header-when-logging-remote_addr.
- Changed: Failed login attempts from unknown and known users are now grouped together. This change was made because a hacker could make many login attempts to a site and rotate the logins, so they would try with both existing and non existing user names, which would make the log flood with failed login attempts.
- Changed: use "n similar events" instead of "n more", to more cleary mark that the grouped events are not necessary exactly the same kind.
- Changed: Quick stats text changed, to also include other sources. Previous behavior was to only include events from WordPress users, but now also events from anonymous users and WordPress (like from WP-Cron) are included.

= 2.0.13 (January 2015) =

= 2.0.8 (December 2014) =

- Added: IP addresses can now be clicked to view IP address info from [ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io). This will get you the location and network of an IP address and help you determine from where for example a failed login attempt originates from.

- Added: new action `simple_history/admin_footer`, to output HTML and JavaScript in footer on pages that belong to Simple History
- Added: new trigger for JavaScript: `SimpleHistory:logReloadStart`. Fired when the log starts to reload, like when using the pagination or using the filter function.

- Fix: use correct width for media attachment
- Add: filter `simple_history/logrowhtmloutput/classes`, to modify HTML classes added to each log row item

= 2.0.6 (November 2014) =

- Added: [WordPress 4.1 added the feature to log out a user from all their sessions](http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1#Users). Simple History now logs when a user is logged out from all their sessions except the current browser, or if an admin destroys all sessions for a user. [View screenshot of new session logout log item](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k4cmfmncekmfiib/2014-12-simple-history-changelog-user-sessions.png)

- Added: filter to shortcut loading of a dropin. Example that completely skips loading the RSS-feed-dropin:

  this would result in something like this:
  Starship "USS Enterprise" repaired
  by admin (John Doe), just now
