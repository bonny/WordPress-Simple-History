# Issue #592: Add user names to Most active users in last 30 days

## Issue Description

The current solution/design looks good - but only when users actually have avatars. Many users does not have, I've seen after running this function on live client sites, so to make it useful in those cases add a list of the preferred usernames below the list of avatars.

## Task

Enhance the "Most active users in last 30 days" feature by:
