# Voice Samples

These excerpts define the target voice for Simple History blog posts. Match this tone.

## General Product Updates & Announcements

### Panic Blog - Friendly, Direct, Human

> "Hello, friends. Readers of this blog probably know us best for our developer-focused apps. But we also publish video games—and we have a really special one to introduce to you, out now for you to play."

> "We never like removing functionality from our apps. We especially don't like doing it when it's due to circumstances beyond our control."

**What to notice:** Warm opening ("Hello, friends"), acknowledges reader relationship, honest about difficult decisions, no corporate speak.

### Search & Filter - Enthusiastic with Metrics

> "22 new features (!) and 43 bugs squashed across around 6 weeks."

> "The whole process usually takes around 5 steps... v3 simplified extension installation to a simple 1 click to install."

**What to notice:** Genuine excitement (parenthetical "!"), specific numbers build credibility, problem-solution framing makes improvements tangible.

### date-fns - Celebratory but Honest

> "I'm happy to announce the release of v4.0, which includes first-class time zone support and no major breaking changes."

> "This should not affect anyone, except those doing something funny with the internals."

**What to notice:** Sets expectations upfront, honest about edge cases, casual language ("something funny") while being technically precise.

## Feature Explanations

### Claude Blog - Confident and Accessible

> "Claude can now use Skills to improve how it performs specific tasks. Skills are folders that include instructions, scripts, and resources that Claude can load when needed."

> "Think of Skills as custom onboarding materials that let you package expertise, making Claude a specialist on what matters most to you."

**What to notice:** Simple structural explanation first, then relatable analogy. Explains *why* before *how*. Short declarative sentences.

### Josh Comeau - Technical with Personality

> "The migration was honestly pretty frustrating at times 😅"

> "legendary sleuth Jane Manchun Wong showed me why that was a bad idea by spamming the API endpoint and generating tens of thousands of likes. 😅"

**What to notice:** Openly discusses struggles, uses humor, tells stories rather than just explaining. Makes readers feel like they're learning from a peer.

## Technical Documentation

### WordPress Developer Blog - Empathetic Expert

> "Getting served a changelog like that is like picking up your car from the mechanic and finding 'we fixed stuff' on the invoice. Technically true, but completely useless."

> "Before anyone rolls their eyes at me… I get it. Releases can be brutal. There is pressure, late nights, deadlines breathing down your neck, and if the changelog is the one thing holding up the release, it's easy to give it the 'good enough' treatment."

> "A clear changelog is one of the easiest ways to save yourself time in the future! It answers questions before they hit your inbox."

**What to notice:** Everyday metaphors (mechanic invoice), acknowledges reader objections before they arise, frames good practices as self-serving rather than lecturing.

## Voice Patterns to Emulate

### Opening Posts
- Address readers directly ("Hello, friends" or "You might have noticed...")
- Acknowledge the reader's context before diving in
- Don't start with "In this post, we will..."

### Explaining Features
- Lead with the benefit, not the mechanism
- Use analogies to familiar concepts
- Short sentences for complex ideas
- Show, then explain

### Acknowledging Difficulties
- Be honest about trade-offs and limitations
- Say "we" when taking responsibility
- Offer context, not excuses

### Technical Details
- Provide context before code
- Explain *why* something matters, not just *what* it does
- Acknowledge prior art and alternatives

### Enthusiasm
- Use sparingly but genuinely
- Specific excitement ("this is surprisingly useful") over generic ("amazing feature!")
- Let metrics speak (numbers, time saved, problems solved)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- "We're excited to announce..." (show excitement through content, not declaration)
- "Simply" or "just" (dismissive of complexity)
- "In today's fast-paced world..." (cliché padding)
- Starting with definitions ("A changelog is...")
- Passive voice for actions ("it was decided" → "we decided")
- Over-promising ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
